### Agents

https://github.com/sergey-lvovich-kim/ValoStat/assets/91290086/82549460-64a8-4c72-86e6-f66e31c95dc2

Agents are playable characters with unique abilities and characteristics. Each agent in Valorant has a distinct playstyle and set of abilities that can be used strategically during matches. Agents have different roles such as duelists, controllers, initiators, and sentinels, each contributing to the overall team composition and strategy.

Agents in Valorant are designed to offer a variety of tactical options and playstyles, allowing players to choose the agent that best suits their preferred approach to the game. The abilities of agents can range from offensive tools like damage-dealing and mobility skills to defensive abilities such as healing, area denial, or vision control.

By selecting an agent in Valorant, players can leverage their unique abilities to gain an advantage in engagements, control map areas, provide utility to their team, or create opportunities for strategic plays. Mastering the abilities and understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each agent is crucial for success in Valorant's fast-paced and tactical gameplay.

You can navigate through each agent's description & hear the voice.

### Weapons

Overall, Valorant's weapons are designed to balance skill, strategy, and decision-making. Mastering the various weapons, understanding their strengths and weaknesses, and making smart choices based on the economy system are essential for success in Valorant's competitive gameplay.

You can checkout weapons skins & observe skin chromas (as in the game). Watch the videos of how the skins look like in the game.

### Locale Support

The language localization feature allows users to change the language of the app interface to their preferred language. Currently, only 3 languages supported [English, Korean, Russian]. Changing app language leads to translating all the content of the app even including Agents' voices.

Also, App language can be changed in App's settings outside of the App.
